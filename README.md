## React-Express-ES6-Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for creating react apps with an express backend using ES6 syntax. It uses webpack to utilize hot reloading.

Run the following command to to watch for any changes to the code and automatically precompile ES6 (using Babel) and JSX and SCSS:

```
npm run watch
```
(Note: this will create a webpack dev-server running on port 8080)


Run the express.js server, which will run on port 3000:

```
node server
```
